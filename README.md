**OpenThreatTaxonomy-v1.1.xls** - Spreadsheet of threats from the Open Threat Taxonomy (v1.1).

I wanted to be able to sort these by threat level and couldn't find a spreadsheet version, so I created one. See [Open Threat Taxonomy] (https://www.auditscripts.com/resources/open_threat_taxonomy_v1.1a.pdf) for more information.

**LargeScaleAgileNotes.docx** - Notes on scaling Agile for large organizations from two YouTube talks.
